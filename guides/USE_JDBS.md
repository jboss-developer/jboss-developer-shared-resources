Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts
============================================================

You can also deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. 

For information on how to configure Maven and JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) for use with the quickstarts, see the [Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.2/html-single/Getting_Started_Guide/index.html "Getting Started Guide") for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. 

See [Getting Started Developing Applications](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/guide/Introduction/ "Get Started Developing Applications") on the JBoss Developer Framework web site for quickstart tutorials and additional information.
